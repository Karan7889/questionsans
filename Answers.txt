1. To generate the ssh key in our respective system like i am a windows user then firstly go in our command prompt type thr word ssh keygen then the key will be generated then go to the Windows C -> Users -> Your name (for example in my pc it's karan) -> .ssh -> id_rsa.pub 
after that open the id_rsa.pub file via notepad then copy the key inside of that and then go to the github -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys ->new ssh key -> paste the key and then create the ssh key . This will complete the steps of generating the ssh key and add it to the github.
